## Engineering Thesis – Stock Market Liquidity Analysis

A Python application designed for comparative liquidity analysis of stock market companies.  
The project calculates **Relative Volume (RV)** and **Zero1/Zero2** liquidity indicators, analyzes trends across different time periods (pre-COVID, COVID, and the full 2017–2025 dataset), and visualizes results to support financial decision-making and liquidity risk assessment.

### **Project Scope**
- Data acquisition and preprocessing  
- Calculation of RV and Zero1/Zero2 liquidity risk metrics  
- Time-series segmentation (pre-COVID, COVID, full period)  
- Comparative analysis across multiple companies  
- Visualizations highlighting liquidity changes and risk patterns  

### **Technologies Used**
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
